# SCADA_GUI_Input_Data_Set
A set of raw output files generated by our SCADA intrusion and botnet detection software, which can be used to test new GUI designs.

In the test data set, detection outputs from two substations (generated by running the detection algorithm on two different sets of SCADA network traces) are organized as follows:

--- Substation_1_GUI_Test_Data: 
         Detection output, flows observed during each time window, detailed flow records, and description of test network in Substation 1.

--- Substation_2_GUI_Test_Data: 
         Detection output, flows observed during each time window, detailed flow records, and description of test network in Substation 2.
         
Note that flow records are provided as JSON stubs since our initial GUI design uses JSON. In addition, two separate folders are provided, which include JSON stubs for all types of outputs.
